## About the dataset used in this chapter (World Ocean Atlas 2018)
In this chapter we use a small, tidy extract of **World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18)** climatologies for the broader Southern Africa region.

Why WOA matters in ocean science:

- **Temperature** and **salinity** are the fundamental state variables of seawater, and together shape density and stratification.
- **Dissolved oxygen** is a key indicator of ventilation, productivity, and habitat suitability.
- **Nutrients** (nitrate, phosphate, silicate) constrain primary production and structure ecosystems.

These variables are not “just numbers”: they encode the physical and biogeochemical structure of the ocean.
